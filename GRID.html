          <p class="para">Hello, I'm Tulika Arun and I'm extremely inquisitive.
                          Science fascinates me. Ever since I started my schooling, I have had a curiosity to explore each and everything present around me, and as I started to expand my knowledge, I started asking more questions and wanting answers to all of them. This eagerness to understand why everything happens made me fall in love with Physics and Computers.
                            Right now, I'm interested in web development and language proficiency. I'm learning all about HTML - CSS - JavaScript and have quite a good grasp on Python (2.7, 3).
                            Physics has taught me why and how the universe and life work whereas Computer Science has taught me that there isn't just one but many ways to handle all the problems in our lives.</p>


          <p class="part-2">Art fascinates me as much as science does. Here are a few things that I know other than the above two:

                            - I studied Hindustani Classical Vocal at Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, New Delhi for four years, so I have performed on various occasions in my school and university by being a part of the music society.

                            - I can paint, write and have good oration skills. I've written some poems (mostly for myself) and spoken on stage on a lot of occasions - debates, elocutions, plays. I was a member of the TEDx - NIIT University (2020) and worked with the creative, customer management and the speaker's experience team.

                            - I am also in love with the smell of new books. I have a keen interest in fiction and mythological novels.


                            When I am not sitting with my laptop typing down some code or reading something about the quantum world, you can find me doing one of these things - or watching re runs of The Office U.S. </p>
